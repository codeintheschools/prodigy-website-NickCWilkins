            <p class="aboutText">I am currently a senior at Digital Harbor Highschool, where I transferred to in order to further my skills. There I learned much more about computers and was able to gain hands-on experience. Even before this, technology has been one of my core interests, so I'm very experienced!  I haven't stopped there though, I'm still trying to get better. For the past few years I've spent a lot of time preparing to get a job doing something I love. Mostly through practice and hard work to learn new skills.<br /><br /></p>

            <p class="aboutText">I've recently taken to learning front-end web development, and it's been one of my best decisions yet! I can take personal requests for websites as well, head over to my <a class="selected" href="index.html">home</a> page to see some of the work i've done, or my <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page to get in touch.</p>
